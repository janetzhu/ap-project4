The immune system protects the body from harmful germs and diseases.
HIV weakens the immune system, allowing germs and diseases to attack the body.
When initially infected, a person may experience a flu-like sickness.
HIV can remain dormant for up to 10 years in an "incubation" state, without showing any symptoms.
You cannot tell if someone has HIV by looking at him or her.
You can make choices to avoid getting or spreading HIV/AIDS.  It is a completely preventable disease if you know how to avoid it.
The only way for someone to know his or her HIV status is to go for HIV testing.
Certain hospitals and clinics offer free HIV testing. It is very important to know your status so that you can make the right decisions to avoid other health complications.
HIV is not the same thing as AIDS. HIV is the virus that causes your immune system to break down, which can lead to AIDS.
Without treatment, HIV usually causes the disease AIDS in 2 to 10 years.
There is currently no cure for HIV, but there are drugs that attack HIV in your body called anti-retrovirals.  These drugs can help a person with HIV/AIDS live 10 to 20 years longer.
